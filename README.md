# DictionaryHashAttack
Python Script that allows you to find a password given it's hash.

## Requirements
1. You must have python 3.x and install the hashlib module
2. You must know the hash you are cracking
3. You must find your own dictionary of passwords (or use the one I provided from https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-1000000.txt)
